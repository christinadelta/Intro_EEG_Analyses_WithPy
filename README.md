# Introduction to Analyses of Neural Data with Python
This a **very** introductory tutorial on how to analyse EEG recordings with Python. It covers topics of very basic python commands and types of files and detailed (step by step) introduction of analysisng EEG data.

### Dependencies:
Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib 

### Important Note:

I do not have permission to share the dataset that I am using here. This series on (very) Introductory Notebooks for Analyses of EEG data is intended to the students that I supervise. 

However, in the near future I will post more EEG analyses notebooks with **open data**.
