# Introduction to Analyses of Neural Data with Python
This a **very** introductory tutorial on how to analyse EEG recordings with Python. It covers topics of very basic python commands and types of files and detailed (step by step) introduction of analysisng EEG data.

### Dependencies:
Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib 

## Notebooks Content
* **Importing EEG data**. This is the first Notebook. It describes how to import data in Pyhton.
* **Introduction on ERPs**. This is the second Notebook. It covers topics such as: visual inspection and plotting of the EEG signal, averaging ERPs, computing Confidaence Intervals (CIs).
* **Introduction to EEG Power Spectrum**. This is the third Notebook. It covers topics such as: Variance, SD, Autocovariance of the EEG data, Discrete Fourier Transform, Power Spectral Density (PSD), the Spectogram. 

### Important Note:

This introductory tutorial is based on this series of [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFsUKOZPGfa4V9Artaae6gw/playlists) and on the Tutorials: Case-Studies in Neural Data Analysis with Python, but I have removed some parts and replaced them with a other that I believe are more important. I am also using a different dataset. This dataset was analysed in matlab with EEGlab, I saved the data in mat files in order to easily import them in Python.

I do not have permission to share the dataset that I am using here. This series on (very) Introductory Notebooks for Analyses of EEG data is intended to the students that I supervise. 

However, in the near future I will post more EEG analyses notebooks with **open data**.
