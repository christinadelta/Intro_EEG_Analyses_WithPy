    "In short, Power Spectrum Analysis or Power Spectral Density (PSD) is one of the standard methods used to quantify the EEG signal. **Power spectrum** reflects the frequency content (related to the activity bands introduced in the 2nd notebook), or the distribution of signal power over frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will be introduced to a few fundamental aspects of analysing EEG (or MEG) data. We will walk step-by step through more efficient ways of conducting visual inspection of the EEG, we will focus even more on the measures of spread (variance, sd, mean) and on autocovariance, we will learn about the spectral density (or power spectrum), about the Fourier Transform and more."

Before moving to the more details parts that come next, please make sure to play around with the code of the overview and make sure you understand all the aspects. In my experience, understanding the EEG signal can be difficult and it will probably require effort, but if you spend some time in the beginning to comprehend all the fundamental aspects, then, when the time comes and you analyse your own data, things will be much easier."
