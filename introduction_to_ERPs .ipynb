    "\n",
    "The voltage recording that comes from the scalp's surface (electroencephalogram) provides very useful information abou the temporal dynamics of neural activity, at the level of milliseconds. One of the main reasons we run EEG analyses is to investigate the **neural oscillations** or **rhythmic activity** whci is observed in different frequencies: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Delta activity is observed at 1-4Hz** and is  linked to a broad variety of perceptual, sensorimotor, and cognitive operations.  Delta rhythms are very commonly associated with the deep stage 3 of NREM sleep, also known as slow-wave sleep (SWS), and aid in characterizing the depth of sleep.\n",
    "* **Theta activity is observed at 5-8Hz** and underlies various aspects of cognition and behavior, including learning, memory, and spatial navigation in many animals. There are two types of theta activity: *the hippocampal theta rhythm*, a strong oscillation that can be observed in the hippocampus and other brain structures and the *cortical theta rhythm*, low-frequency components of scalp EEG, usually recorded from humans. \n",
    "* **Alpha activity is observed at 8-12Hz**, likely originating from the synchronous and coherent (in phase or constructive) electrical activity of thalamic pacemaker cells in humans. Alpha activity is the most studied one and is thought to have at least two different forms, which may have different functions in the wake-sleep cycle:  \n",
    "    * The most widely researched is during the relaxed mental state, where the subject is at rest with eyes closed, but is not tired or asleep. This alpha activity is centered in the occipital lobe, although there has been speculation that it has a thalamic origin.\n",
    "    * The second form of alpha wave activity is during REM sleep. As opposed to the awake form of alpha activity, this form is located in a frontal-central location in the brain. The purpose of alpha activity during REM sleep is not yet fully understood. Currently, there are arguments that alpha patterns are a normal part of REM sleep, and for the notion that it indicates a semi-arousal period.\n",
    "* **Beta activity is observed at 13-30Hz**, they are associated with normal waking consciousness and can be split into three sections:\n",
    "    * Low Beta Waves (12.5–16 Hz) or **Beta 1 power**\n",
    "    * Beta Waves (16.5–20 Hz) or **Beta 2 power**\n",
    "    * High Beta Waves (20.5–29 Hz) or **Beta 3 power**\n",
    "* **Gamma activity is observed at 30-200Hz**. In humans, a gamma Rhythm is a pattern of neural oscillation with a frequency between 25 and 140 Hz, with the 40-Hz point being of particular interest. Gamma rhythms are correlated with large scale brain network activity and cognitive phenomena such as working memory, attention, and perceptual grouping.\n",

So, we make the assumption that the trials are independent; this means that what happens in one trial is not dependent to what happens in the next trial. We also assume that the EEG data are well behaved. This means that when we compute the mean and standard diviation their values are not going to be extreme but reasonable. We therefore conclude that the ERP at every trial and at each moment in time are normally distributed (for detailed information about normal distributions look [here](https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/normal-distribution/)). \n",
